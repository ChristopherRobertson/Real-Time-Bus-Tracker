# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description

This project Tracks the Buses between MIT and Harvard in real time. It updates the coordinates every few seconds and places a pin, either red or blue, depending on which direction the bus is going along the route. 

##  Useage

Clone the respository and load the index.html file into a browser

## Roadmap

I would like to add more bus routes to the map and maybe change it the city I live in
